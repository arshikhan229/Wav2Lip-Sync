# Wav2Lip-Sync

This project demonstrates how to use Wav2Lip for generating deepfake videos where lip movements are synchronized with the given audio.

## Prerequisites

1. **Wav2Lip Repository and Pre-trained Models**
   - Clone the Wav2Lip repository from [here](https://github.com/zabique/Wav2Lip).
   - Download the pre-trained Wav2Lip GAN model.
   - Download the pre-trained face detection model.

2. **Google Colab**
   - The script is designed to run on Google Colab for ease of use and access to necessary resources.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Wav2Lip-Sync.git
   cd Wav2Lip-Sync

## bash

pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the environment variables:

Copy the example environment file to .env:

## bash

cp .env.example .env
Edit the .env file to add your URLs for the checkpoint and face detection model.

## Usage
Ensure you have the necessary models downloaded as mentioned in the prerequisites.

Run the setup script to prepare the environment:

## bash
